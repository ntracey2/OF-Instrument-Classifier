* I am encountering several strange errors with the ofxMaxim library. I believe this is due to the lack of support with the lasted version of visual studio. I have resolved some of the macro issues but there still seems to be a preprocessor error.
* I decided to look into different libraries that would make featuer extraction much simpler than maximilian. I found two specifically that would be great to incorporate into the project, yaafe and Essentia, but unfortunately they are not designed for windows use. While it is possible to use on Windows, they both take a very painful cross-compilation process, and they wouldn't even be compatible with visual studio as they binaries would rely on MinGW. I searched for an equivalent library that I could integrate well into visual studio but could not find anything. I really want to experiment with these specific libraries though, so I spent far too much time playing around with a linux setup. This opened up a whole new world of complications as there seems to be some foundational issues with openframeworks' linux support.
* I decided to switch to the Marsyas library as they provide a precompiled library for windows. The library is complex but contains the features I wish to use in my project. As of now my Visual Studio project is successfully linked to the library.
* After running into far too many problems with the implementation of Marsyas (various dll errors with no helpful debugging resources), I made a final search for libraries that would work for my project. I believe that I have finally found the perfect setup, as I discovered two OpenFrameworks addons that seem to cover what I need for proper feature extraction. The first addon is ofxAudioFile, which simply reads in a WAV or mp3 file and converts it to a time domain representation of the sound in the form of a float array. I am able to pass this array into ofxGist, which is an openframeworks wrapper for the audio analysis library Gist. It takes an array of float samples as an input and has a very simple process of extracting features such as the MFCC, ZCR, and RMS. Currently my program can read in a single WAV file and compute the ZCR, RMS, and Peak Energy value of the signal.
