* I am encountering several strange errors with the ofxMaxim library. I believe this is due to the lack of support with the lasted version of visual studio. I have resolved some of the macro issues but there still seems to be a preprocessor error.
* I decided to look into different libraries that would make featuer extraction much simpler than maximilian. I found two specifically that would be great to incorporate into the project, yaafe and Essentia, but unfortunately they are not designed for windows use. While it is possible to use on Windows, they both take a very painful cross-compilation process, and they wouldn't even be compatible with visual studio as they binaries would rely on MinGW. I searched for an equivalent library that I could integrate well into visual studio but could not find anything. I really want to experiment with these specific libraries though, so I spent far too much time playing around with a linux setup. This opened up a whole new world of complications as there seems to be some foundational issues with openframeworks' linux support.
